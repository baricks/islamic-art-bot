"I once asked a bird, how is it that you fly in this gravity of darkness? She responded, 'love lifts me.'"
"I wish I could show you...the astonishing light of your own being."
"Stay close to anything that makes you glad you are alive."
"Fear is the cheapest room in the house. I would like to see you living in better conditions."
"This place where you are right now, God circled on a map for you."
"Your heart and my heart are very, very old friends."
"The heart is a thousand stringed instrument that can only be tuned with love."
"Be kind to your sleeping heart. Take it out into the vast fields of light...And let it breathe."
"You yourself are your own obstacle, rise above yourself."
"What we speak becomes the house we live in."
"Love sometimes wants to do us a great favor: hold us upside down and shake all the nonsense out."
"Carry your heart through this world like a life-giving sun"
