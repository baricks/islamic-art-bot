# Islamic Art Bot

 A little Twitter bot that tweets out examples of beautiful Islamic art, architecture, and poetry. A work in progress.

 You can find the Twitter bot in its current state here: https://twitter.com/IslamArtBot

 Much of the inspiration and code was taken from Darius Kazemi's delightful Museum Bot, which can be seen here: https://github.com/dariusk/museumbot
